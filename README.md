Mental Health Project


Mental health has been a growing concern for many people worldwide. The fast-paced and demanding lifestyle of modern society has led to an increase in stress, anxiety, depression, and other mental health disorders. Unfortunately, many people do not seek professional help due to the stigma attached to mental health disorders. During pandemics also because of strict lockdown we had to stay in home. We had a lot of time as we had nothing to do, we people keep thinking about various stuff and because of over thinking, frustration, less confidence we get annoyed/angry. Because of such thoughts revolves in our mind and that impacts our mental health. In general, it has been seen that our society is not yet so open towards mental health talk. And even if we try to, we either get judged or labelled as mentally ill. 
To address this challenge, mental health applications have been developed.
